## Jaime Torres' Portfolio 

I am a computer science Major at CSUF and I plan on graduating on 2028. 

Lab 12: Lab 12 is my favorite lab that we worked on this semester. Not only was it hard, but it was rewarding to see the gif that we were able to make. Learning and using RGB along with the Magick tool was fun and it is something that I think will be useful in the future. 

Lab 4: My second favorite lab that we worked on this semester was the HiLo game which was fun to make. Since it was earlier in the semester, it wasnâ€™t that difficult, however using the if statements, along with the if else statements was fun. Using If and If Else statements will be very useful for the future. 

Lab 8: Lab 8 is my third favorite lab that we worked on because it was fun to check if we made a sandwich or not. At first I was confused on how to check the argument size, but after I found how to do that, it was easy. The same thing applies to the location of the argument. The commands argument size and argument at, became very useful.
